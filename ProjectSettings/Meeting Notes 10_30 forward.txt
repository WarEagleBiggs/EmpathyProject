#Mendonca
Working on displaying dosages on the syringe and when added to the heart
Mendonca demo a success! talks afterwards include laying out the concept of pulling data to the foreground in a different viewer once data record stops with options to pan and view the graph with labels/save and export data for later processing
Syringe "hard to handle"
Linda is concerned we have not seen other scenarios for other drugs, we talked a good bit of how those will be created based on what we have
Goals: week of Nov. 14 have two drug interactions so class can demo in afternoon labels/save
	Main priority of working on saving, exporting data
